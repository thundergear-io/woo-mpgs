This plugin extends WooCommerce with MasterCard Payment Gateway Services (MPGS).

== Description ==

This plugin implements a Hosted Checkout integration of the MasterCard Payment Gateway Services (MPGS). It has 2 checkout options, either redirect the user to MPGS payment gateway page, or pay through a popup/lightbox on your website without redirection outside your website.
